# DiscoCavern
I have not uploaded the Unreal Engine Project Files to Github for now but here is link for this and all Game Files: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W1QGJH4z8B2WRWj6D_pvyuMqB3qBfUnQ?usp=sharing

Developed with Unreal Engine. For gameplay video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmxXIkhjH-o&list=PL8pigdE7Oeb3couSwPXJSrcNjad9NlDSR&index=4

When Disco Cavern was actually a simple arcade game that I watched from the tutorial. With the "time-dependent colour change function" I added to it, it turned into a project that I liked visually.

The game in which we collect disco crystals can be played with both keyboard and gamepad. Due to my busy schedule, I only made one test map and couldn't add too many mechanics, but I'm thinking about a few more mechanics.
